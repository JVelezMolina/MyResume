   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>I am a self-taught person dedicated to improving every day, Passionate about carrying out daily tasks but never leaving aside humanism. I like to help people and due to a total change of country of residence and life I dedicated myself to customer service and sales. However, I have never given up on my goal (being a developer engineer) and even though I have not been able to dedicate myself fully until now, I have always been learning.</p>
